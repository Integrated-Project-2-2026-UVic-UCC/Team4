## 🌍 Why This Project?

In informal football matches, scorekeeping often depends entirely on players remembering the goals. This frequently leads to confusion, disagreements, or simply losing track of the score. There is no standardized or reliable system available for public fields and recreational environments.

SmartGoal is designed to solve this issue through technology. By integrating sensors directly into the goal structure, the system automatically detects when the ball fully crosses the goal line. This guarantees objective scoring without requiring referees or manual input.

The result is a fairer, more immersive, and more professional playing experience — even in casual matches.

## 🧩 Project Vision

Our aim is to create an accessible and robust smart goal system that can be installed on standard football goals without altering gameplay.

The system focuses on three key principles:

- Precision in goal detection  
- Instant feedback for players  
- Simplicity of installation and use  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

The SmartGoal system combines hardware and software into a compact, autonomous unit:

### 1️⃣ Detection Layer
Sensors positioned along the goal frame and net determine whether the ball has completely crossed the line.

### 2️⃣ Processing Unit
A microcontroller analyzes sensor signals and validates goals using predefined logic to prevent false positives.

### 3️⃣ Display & Feedback
A digital scoreboard updates automatically and can optionally trigger visual or sound feedback when a goal is scored.

### 4️⃣ Connectivity (Optional)
Wireless communication allows match data to be viewed on a mobile device or stored for later analysis.
